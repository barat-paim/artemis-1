Great! The Alpaca dataset has been prepared successfully. Let's analyze what we have:

1. **Dataset Statistics**:
- Total examples: 1,611
- Categories:
  - Text transformation: 500
  - Q&A: 500
  - Grammar: 500
  - Summarization: 111 (fewer examples available)

2. **Data Structure**:
```
alpaca/
├── data/
│   ├── alpaca_prepared/
│   │   ├── train/        # 90% of data
│   │   └── validation/   # 10% of data
│   └── alpaca_sample.json
└── scripts/
    └── prepare_alpaca.py
```

Next steps:

1. Create the training script:
```python:scripts/finetune_alpaca.py
# Similar structure to our previous training script but with:
# - Modified data loading for instruction format
# - Adjusted model parameters for instruction tuning
# - Updated evaluation metrics
```

2. Create an evaluation script:
```python:scripts/eval_alpaca.py
# For testing the model on new instructions
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create the training script next?
2. Show some sample prompts for testing?
3. Explain the instruction tuning approach in detail?

The dataset looks well-balanced (except for summarization, which is okay), and we're ready to start training!
